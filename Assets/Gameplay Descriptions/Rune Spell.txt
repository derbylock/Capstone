Runes are round in shape and placed on a specific spot on the ground. While it could 
theoretically have just about any shape, it would be easiest to handle a cylindrical
collider. The rune also needs a texture which will define its appearance and serve as 
a visual reference to all players as to the size and position of the rune. The 
possibility for a particle effect to activate on triggering the rune is not entirely 
necessary but should remain an option.

The quick and dirty option for doing the visuals of this is to use a projector with a
fairly narrow distance, but the results are sporadic and sometimes faded in various 
parts on uneven terrain
